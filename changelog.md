For the most part, I feel that my webpage was already styled well, and all the content that
I want to have is already included from previous assignments... Some site changes I added:

Site Changes:
- Added 20px padding to the footer so that it is not touching the very bottom of the page
- Added links to both work experiences: Innovive and Floor & Decor
- Optimized all images using tinypng.com
- Added background images for Home page and Project page
